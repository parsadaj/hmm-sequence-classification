# hmm-sequence-classification
classifying sequences using hidden markov models

In this project (which was a part of my NLP homeworks in spring 2021 as a master's student), I trained different hmm models on different sequences and for some kind of language model. When these models see a new sequene they can compute probabilty of that sequence and determine to which language model (or class) they belong.
